            <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1><br>
        <p>So we all know that we were created by God in the begining of the universe and the rest of the story follows.
            Have you ever wondered what God meant when He said<i> "Let us now create God in our own image"</i>? Have you sat down to analyse 
            this statement and if God truly created us in His own image? It's true He did create us in His own image. We know God to be "the Father
            ,the Son, the Holy Spirit", three in one. Looking at us too we are also three in one. If you take a look at yourself we know that we are
            made of the body or flesh, soul and spirit. So we are truly made in the image of God. </p><br>

       <p>We must note that whatever we do to one of our part (the body, soul and spirit) affect each other. Looking at the lifestyle
        of Jesus Christ on earth, whatever he did had an effect on (the Father) because all he did brought glory to the Father. The Holy Spirit 
        empowered Jesus Christ which helped him to withstand and overcome the devil. So in all the worked together to bring glory to each other.
        Same as we are, whatever we do to one part of us will either bring a positive or negative impact on the other part. All the roles played
        by (the Father, Son and Holy Spirit) brought a positive impact to themselves.
       </p><br>
       <p>Following on, we'll be learning more about the above topic and <i>"OUR QUEST IN LIFE".</i> </p>
     <br><br>


     <h2>OUR PURPOSE....</h2>
     <p>After the creation of Adam and Eve, God gave them a purpose. They were "to be fruitful amd multiply" <i>ref... RSV Bible Genesis 1v28.</i>
        Throught the Bible, God gave purposes to man to fulfil. All purposes given was to the benefit of men. If these purposes weren't given
        then I believe that man would have been doomed and the greatest purpose ever given and fulfilled was that of our personal saviour
        Christ Jesus. His purpose was one that has saved generations before and yet to come. If he hadn't fulfilled his purpose then I
        assume probably that man would be in a whole lot of mess.
     </p><br>
     <p>Just as Moses, Abraham, Daniel,Noah, Mary Mother of Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ and his disciples just to mention a few, were given purposes
        and they fulfiled it, so have we been given by our Father. We all are required to fulfil our assigned purposes. If and when we fail to complete
        our purpose we'll be punished just as in the case of Noah.
    </p><br>
    <p>Wherever you are right now reading this or whatever situation you find yourself know that God has put you there specifically for a reason.
        Moving on, some of our purposes may not be as big as what Christ came to do for us. Our purposes can either be big or small. As of the
        time i'm typing this, I read a blog on <i>Phoenix browser</i> about a two-year-old boy who hugged a pizza delivery guy when he was returning
        to his car.</p>
        <p>Not knowing at that time the pizza guy had just lost his 16 year old daughter from a mental illness. When the mother of this young
        boy posted the video and the pizza guy saw it he said <i>"it did him a lot of good after recieving that hug".</i> It was like God was 
            trying to comfort the pizza guy by using the two-year-old boy as His vessel. You might have gotten a chance to see videos captured
            where people were able to save others from some mishaps. It is because God placed those saviours at those particular places.
    </p><br>
    <p>At a point in our life we may think or feel that we have no purpose in life and that we are here for nothing. Be encouraged in the Lord
       that it's the case and every living thing has a purpose even the trees and animals do have their purpose.    
    </p><br><br>
    <h4>Result of our disobedience or failure</h4>
    <p>We've all read or heard about Jonah who was asked by God to preach to the people of Ninevh but refused initially. What happened to him?
        It was said that on the ship he was on to Tarshish God caused a mighty storm on it and caused him to be throw into the sea and was swallowed
        by a whale. A punishment will be met out to us if we don't fulfil our purpose.
